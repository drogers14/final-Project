  <h1>Your Story</h1>
  <div style="float: left; width:45%">
    Once upon a time there was a/an <span id=animals></span>, who was trying to
     get a loan for a/an <span id=input2></span>. He has to meet with
    <span id=input3></span> in order to get transportation by <span id=input4></span>.
   To cross the river, <span id=input5></span> held you at gun point, they work for <span id=input6></span>.
   You remember that their weakness is the smell of <span id="input7"></span> food.

 <div style="float: right; width: 45%">
   So you threw the delicacy at them and they fled. When they split they left
   behind a <span id="input8"></span> container. You pick up the box and
   <span id="input9"></span> fall out. You remember your friend who worked for
   that villain, and you decided that you don't want to be like them. You don't keep the items of the container
   so you donate them to the <span id="input10"></span> <span id="input11">
   </span> Orphanage. Mayor <span id="input12"></span> saw your generous act and
    awarded you the key to the city. The Mayor also helped you with your loan.
