<div style="float: left; width:45%">
I was taking my usual hike at <span id="input1"></span> Hill one November evening.
The trail was wide and rocky with nothing but <span id="input2"></span> grassy
fields on both sides. I was <span id="input3"></span> miles away from my noisy
city, away from civilization. As I walked, I saw my favorite tree up ahead. It
was a giant oak tree with an old <span id="input4"></span> bird bath beside it
full of dirty water and a rusty old metal <span id="input5"></span>. At least,
that's how I remember it. As I got closer I noticed something strange about the
tree. I tookout my <span id="input6"></span> and shined its light on the tree.
To my horror I saw <span id="input7"></span>colored drops dripping from its trunk.
The tree was infested with roaches feeding off of its remaining black <span id="input8"></span>
 leaves and its rotting branches emmitted fumes that smelled of <span id="input9"></span>.

 The bird bath was not filled with dirty water anymore but rather a yellow liquid
 that smelled of sewage. The bench was wrapped in rusty barbed wire. All of a
 sudden I froze and sweat dripped from my <span id=input10></span> when I looked
  up into the tree and saw a creature perched on one of the branches. It had a box shaped
 head, oily and gross hair, red colored eyes, and a nasty breath that smelled
 like rotten <span id="input11"></span>. It smiled a devilish smile. And told me that it
would rip off my scalp, boil my eyes, scratch my <span id="input12"></span> off,
and send the remaining parts of my body to Beelzebub the evil skank lord. Accepting
my fate, I cried and my tears tasted like <span id="input13"></span>.
